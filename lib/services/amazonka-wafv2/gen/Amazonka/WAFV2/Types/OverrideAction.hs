-- | The action to use in the place of the action that results from the rule
-- group evaluation. Set the override action to none to leave the result of
-- the rule group alone. Set it to count to override the result to count
-- only.

-- like @RuleGroupReferenceStatement@ and @ManagedRuleGroupStatement@.
--
-- This option is usually set to none. It does not affect how the rules in

-- only count matches, do not use this and instead exclude those rules in
-- your rule group reference statement settings.
